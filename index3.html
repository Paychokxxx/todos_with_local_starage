                <h4>Superhero</h4>
                <p>A superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero or Super) is a type of heroic stock character, usually
                    possessing supernatural or superhuman powers, who is dedicated to fighting the evil of his/her universe,
                    protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine
                    (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the word superhero is commonly used for females
                    also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American
                    comic book and films since the 1930s.</p>
